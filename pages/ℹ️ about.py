By leveraging Streamlit developers can build interactive applications with machine learning capabilities. The deployed application on Streamlit Cloud allows easy access to users, making it suitable for showcasing and sharing with others. This project serves as an example of integrating deep learning with web development using Streamlit for rapid prototyping and deployment.This project involves creating an interactive web application using Streamlit to detect animal types from uploaded images. Users can upload an image of an animal, and the application will use a trained deep learning model to identify the animal. The project will be deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access around globe üåè. ")
